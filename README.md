AutoWordTest
=====

## What is this?

It is an automatic English word test paper developed by Python.


## Why do this?

This is because I decided to create a program that makes a word test paper according to my teacher's taste when I put the word and its meaning into it after seeing my respected English teacher making one by one.


## Getting started

1. Make the necessary word file like word.xls
2. Download the software "WordTest" that fits your operating system.
3. Execute.
4. Do what the program tells you to do.
