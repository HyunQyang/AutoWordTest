AutoWordTest
=====

## What is this?

It is an automatic English word test paper developed by Python.


## Why do this?

This is because I decided to create a program that makes a word test paper according to my teacher's taste when I put the word and its meaning into it after seeing my respected English teacher making one by one.

## Can I do my own plugins?

Yes you can! See the [Plugin documention in the wiki](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET/wiki/Plugin-API-Documentation)

**Please note that the plugin system is always going to be work in progress and the example might be a bit outdated at times.**
